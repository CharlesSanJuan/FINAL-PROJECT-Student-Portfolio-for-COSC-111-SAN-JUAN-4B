# Laboratory Activity #1 – Working With Digital Signals
## Working with Digital Signals
### Course
**COSC 111 – Internet of Things**

## Overview
This laboratory activity focuses on understanding and applying digital signals using an Arduino microcontroller. The activity demonstrates how digital outputs operate through binary states and timing control.

## Objectives
The objectives of this activity are to:
- Understand digital signal behavior using HIGH and LOW states
- Control multiple output devices using Arduino
- Apply timing and sequencing concepts in digital systems

## Description
In this activity, an Arduino is programmed to control multiple LEDs connected to digital pins. The LEDs turn ON and OFF sequentially with a fixed delay, demonstrating how digital signals transition between states.

This activity highlights how digital outputs behave in real-world electronic systems and their importance in IoT applications.

## Code Explanation
- `setup()` configures the digital pins as OUTPUT.
- `loop()` controls the LEDs by turning them ON and OFF one at a time.
- `delay()` is used to manage timing between signal transitions.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Binary logic
- Digital signal transitions
- Timing and sequencing

## Hardware Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LEDs
- Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Files Included
- `Working-with-Digital-Signals-ACT1.ino`
- `arduino-diagram.jpg`

## Conclusion
This activity demonstrates the fundamentals of digital signal control using Arduino and provides a strong foundation for more advanced IoT system development.
